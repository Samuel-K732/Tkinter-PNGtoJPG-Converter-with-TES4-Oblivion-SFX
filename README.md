# Tkinter-PNGtoJPG-Converter-with-TES4-Oblivion-SFX
Basically this is a desktop program with simple GUI, that saves png images in jpg format. The program works fine with logos such as "papa johns" image, but **does not work** properly with more complex objects such as "tiger" image (see attached examples). All converted images will be automatically saved in "converted" folder.
