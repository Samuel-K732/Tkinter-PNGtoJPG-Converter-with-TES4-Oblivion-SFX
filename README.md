# Tkinter-PNGtoJPG-Converter-with-TES4-Oblivion-SFX
Desktop program with simple GUI, that saves png images in jpg format. The program works fine with logos, but **does not work** properly with more complex objects such as animal images. All converted images will be automatically saved in "converted" folder. GUI is voiced with sound effects from TES4 Oblivion video game.
